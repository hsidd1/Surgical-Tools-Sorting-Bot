# Goal 

### Design a System for Sterilizing Surgical Tools using Remote Sensing and Actuation

# Inspiration

This project was centered around innovations toward the medical field and improving it through the use of modern technology. The goal was to be able to use muscle sensors that would control a Q-arm to move and pick up containers to drop them off for sterilization. Furthermore, specific containers had been modeled in order to fit the specific criteria required for this project (allowing efficient sterilizing and fitting the constraints of printing time and mass limits). 

<h1> Notes </h1>
Code for surgical tools sorting robot run in Quanser Labs environment. Program and environment are on a Raspberry Pi 4 and can be connected to via IP.

Muscle movements are detected through interface in Quanser Labs' simulation environment.
